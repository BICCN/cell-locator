# CellLocator by Allen Institute

Cell Locator is a free, open source and multi-platform pinning tool to facilitate
mapping samples into common 3D spaces.

It is a desktop application based on 3D Slicer that displays the Allen Institute for Brain Science
CCF or MNI atlas, color segmented by structure of the brain, and allows a user to create a planar
polyline annotation to facilitate mapping samples into the corresponding atlas.
